A penny for your thoughts
All bark and no bite
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite off more than you can chew
Blessing in disguise
Break a leg
Burst your bubble
By the skin of your teeth
Can of worms
Caught red-handed
Chase your tail
Chew the fat
Cost an arm and a leg
Crack a smile
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut corners
Cut to the chase
Dark horse
Dead as a doornail
Devil's advocate
